# Welcome to Class Examples!
A lot of these coding examples were based from templates that were provided by the instructors. Not all of the code is original work by Jinelle. However, the main concepts were developed and coded by Jinelle and debugging was completed in order to pass the assignments. 

## Overview of Classes
- Artificial Intelligence - This class covered the main concepts in AI and included topics such as game play, baynes nets, A-star searches, decision trees, K Nearest Neighbor, random forests, and HMMs.
- [Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/JinelleGilfillan/Portfolio/tree/master/Examples%20from%20Class/Knowledge%20Based%20AI) - This class explored the field of AI that addressed AI thinking like humans. Throughout the class, we made iterative improvements to an AI model that was trying to successfully pass Raven's Intelligence Test.
- Human Computer Interaction - The main concepts covered in this class were the steps needed to make acceptable user interfaces. There is not coding examples from this class but it is was incredibly helpful to understand design choices and the process for developing user friendly UX.
- [Machine Learning for Trading](https://github.com/JinelleGilfillan/Portfolio/tree/master/Examples%20from%20Class/Machine%20Learning%20for%20Trading) - This class covered Machine Learning algorithms such as decision trees and bagging, and specifically covers how to apply the algorithms to trading examples.
- AI Ethics and Society - It is important to know the impact of using AI and how it could be misused. This class helped me gain a deeper understanding of the implications and risks of using AI.
- Deep Learning
- Game AI - In this class, we learned about using AI agents in a gaming environment. It was interesting to learn the differences of using AI agents in games versus in other applications.
- Graduate Intro to OS
- Machine Learning
- Software Development Process - This class discussed the typical development process within software projects in a team environment. We learned about using github, making an app in android studio, and the PR and approval process.
