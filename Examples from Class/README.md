# Welcome to Class Examples!
A lot of these coding examples were based from templates that were provided by the instructors. Not all of the code is original work by Jinelle. However, the main concepts were developed and coded by Jinelle and debugging was completed in order to pass the assignments. 

## Overview of Classes
- Artificial Intelligence - This class covered the main concepts in AI and included topics such as game play, baynes nets, A-star searches, decision trees, K Nearest Neighbor, random forests, and HMMs.
- Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence - This class covered the field of AI that addressed AI thinking like humans. Throughout the class, we made iterative improvements to an AI model that was trying to successfully pass Raven's Intelligence Test.
- Human Computer Interaction (current course) - This class covers the steps needed to make acceptable user interfaces. There is not coding examples from this class but it is still important to include.
- Machine Learning for Trading (current course) - This class covers Machine Learning algorithms such as decision trees and bagging, and specifically covers how to apply the algorithms to trading examples.
